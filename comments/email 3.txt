2. The top navigation bar images you sent me are off white in color, I would be interested in seeing them in color as you suggested which if its contrasting would be better I believe , but its upto you.



Also what do you think about reducing the the spacing between the tiles?

4. For the landing page , I noticed that in the link that you sent you changed the font of the logo , please retain the existing font for the logo.
